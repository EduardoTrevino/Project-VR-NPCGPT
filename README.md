#Howdy Howdy Lets get Rowdy!
Welcome to NPCGPT github

Here we are going to outline the entire project managment Plan done by: Eduardo Trevino

The goal of this project was to extend the capabilities of GPT onto a virtual environment. Virtual Reality / Mixed Reality technologies continue to offer humans the ability to expand their creativity while allowing for experiences that would otherwise not be possible. Therefore, extending GPT to access virtual interactions by humans is essential for its continued growth towards Artifical General Intelligence

Breakdown and reason for using Frameworks/Plugins/Technology:
For this Project I decided we should build it using **OpenXR**. OpenXR allows for future XR capabilities and therefore can allow us to upgrade the user interaction as Large Language Models, and other machine learning algorithms scattered all throught the project improve.


## STEP 1:  EU5 Client (occulus quest 2) ##
## STEP 2:  VR Headset Mic Audio ## 
## STEP 3:  Generate speech using human speech ##
## Step 4:  Azure Speech plugin: will be used for Azure speech to text and text to speech vice versa ##
## Step 5:  Http plugin: Send text to OpenAI GPT ##
## Step 6:  OpenAI GPT API generates text ##
## Step 7:  HTTP Gpt plugin receives text from GPT ##
## Step 8:  Azure Speech plugin: Azure text to speech ##

#### TAP SPEECH FROM BUTTOJN PRESS IS OPTIMAL ####
